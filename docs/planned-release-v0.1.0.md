## What was fixed for v0.1.0

### 🐧 Linux — RESOLVED ✅

`TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY` + `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD` repo secrets supplied; `pubkey` in `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` updated to match.

### 🪟 Windows — RESOLVED ✅

**Original error in run #6:** `failed to bundle project 'program path has no file name'` after the build itself completed (~15 min).

**Root cause:** Earlier diagnosis blamed the NSIS installer template, but removing NSIS did not unblock subsequent runs. The actual cause was an empty `"signCommand": ""` literal in `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` `bundle.windows`. Tauri saw a configured custom signing command, split the empty string for execution, and crashed because the program path had no file name.

**Fix in commit `2d8ad97`:** Removed `bundle.windows.signCommand` (and the now-empty `bundle.windows` object) from `tauri.conf.json`. Tauri skips Authenticode signing entirely; MSIs ship unsigned with a SmartScreen "Unknown publisher" prompt the first time. Auto-updater integrity is unaffected — it uses minisign with the `pubkey`, which is independent of Authenticode.

**Follow-up (v0.1.1+):** Wire `signCommand` to `trusted-signing-cli` (Azure Trusted Signing) or `signtool` (EV cert). The `build.yml` reusable workflow already installs `trusted-signing-cli@0.9.0` when `sign-binaries: true`, so the rewire is small.

### 🍎 macOS — DEFERRED ⏸

In commit `2d8ad97`, removed both macOS rows (`macos-26`, `macos-latest`) from the `release.yml` `publish-tauri` matrix. `build.yml` is unchanged, so re-adding macOS support after obtaining an Apple Developer ID certificate is a one-line revert.

## Out of scope for v0.1.0 (logged for v0.1.1+)

- macOS builds (Apple Developer cert + signing/notarization secrets required)
- Windows code signing (Azure Trusted Signing or EV cert + signtool)
- Stale `handy` references in `build.yml` macOS-only steps and `nix-check.yml` flake outputs
- Export-parity eval baseline regeneration (issue #5)
